Do you need a pillow over his head? - Would you smother me?

8
00:00:56,508 --> 00:00:58,300
What? - Is it naughty?

9
00:00:58,468 --> 00:01:01,468
Just as Stella does not wake. - I keep quiet.

10
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:04,132
Okay.

11
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,552
Pardon. It is difficult for me. I say sounds when I love.

12
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:20,008
What was it? - Nothing.

13
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:23,300
You look like you need to throw up. - No.

14
00:01:23,468 --> 00:01:26,592
Is it me? I give you nausea?

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,424
You are my teddy bear, baby. - You look bad.

16
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:33,384
I'm fine. - Have you eaten crab salad?

17
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:36,384
It's you, right? - No.

18
00:01:36,552 --> 00:01:38,008
Oh no.

19
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:39,132
Okay.

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,176
It is okay. Stop.

21
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:47,176
Pardon. - Stop. But you are wildly sexy.

22
00:01:47,344 --> 00:01:48,884
Thanks. - Are you okay?

23
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:52,300
Honey, I'm completely ...

24
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:57,592
Pardon. Honey, I think I'm pregnant.

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,344
Where is the fat! It's great, sweetie.

26
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:06,924
Yes ... Is it weird that I came?

27
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:09,300
4 MONTHS LATER

28
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:11,968
They are here in five minutes. - I'm fucking.

29
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,924
This you have done. - Well I'm nervous.

30
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:18,424
You may do later. - Shit! Okay.

31
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:21,716
Stella, you are constantly mother's dildo.

32
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:24,008
Put it away. - No.

33
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:26,800
Why does she always no? - I do not know.

34
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:30,508
Save your underwear. - Save your bongs.

35
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:42,924
Okay. What is that smell? - Bongvand.

36
00:02:45,092 --> 00:02:47,592
Welcome home! - Come on in.

37
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,008
If therefore will buy the house. - That they might. They like it.

38
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:57,884
Great. - Pardon. We know we are annoying.

39
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:02,052
In're not annoying. What's annoying about it here?

40
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:05,052
The thing is that ...

41
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:09,132
We buy it. - It was...

42
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,008
It was scary. - I love the excitement.

43
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:16,468
Your daughter has been found your vibrator.

44
00:03:16,632 --> 00:03:21,176
Stella ...! She finds it all the time. - Put it away, Stels.

45
00:03:21,344 --> 00:03:23,632
No. - She has just learned that word.

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,760
I think it's the same, I have. - But ours is black.

47
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:34,008
Black cock.

48
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:39,924
Should not we sign? - Yes, let's do it.

49
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:43,760
SOLD

50
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:47,132
We have sold our house! - Quiet now.

51
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,424
I have not sold it yet. The transaction is subject.

52
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:52,592
CONDITIONAL TRADE

53
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,176
Are you røvrende us? - What?

54
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:58,676
I said that I knew what a conditional commerce.

55
00:03:58,844 --> 00:04:02,800
Say it again, just to refresh our memory.

56
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:08,884
It is a cooling off period of 30 days, where buyers can make an overhaul.

57
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:13,884
And if all goes well, and you do not scare them away, so the deal is closed.

58
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:18,968
Do we withdraw our new house? - No.

59
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:22,424
Why not, dammit? - There was submitted several bids on it.

60
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:26,424
I would have it at any cost. - Yes it's true.

61
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:32,260
I asked three times, you realize what a cooling off period?

62
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:35,592
And again nodded in just.

63
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,716
Just as I do now. That was how the housing bubble occurred.

64
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:43,552
The buyers must stop by anytime. Okay?

65
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:45,344
Okay.

66
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:49,716
So do not crap the next 30 days. - Speak nicely.

67
00:04:49,884 --> 00:04:54,508
She has a dildo in hand. - It's not a dildo. It is...

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,260
Toy. - From a cartoon.

69
00:04:57,424 --> 00:05:00,216
A Japanese anime cartoons.

70
00:05:00,552 --> 00:05:03,008
The cartoons I see every night.

71
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:06,384
We're fucking getting old. - Why do you say that?

72
00:05:06,552 --> 00:05:10,092
Because our friends die. - Who dies?

73
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,208
Do you remember Joe Waterston? Death. - Is that right?

74
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:18,292
He was going to check a suspicious mole on her shoulder.

75
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,668
He was run over by a bus. Death. - Are you okay?

76
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:26,916
No, I'm not okay! I kokser that Paula is pregnant. I know how it is not.

77
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:29,584
You will be a good father. - No.

78
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:32,584
I know nothing about it. Children should not be alone.

79
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:36,544
Do not let the child stay home when going to the movies.

80
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,876
I knew that. - Did you?

81
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:43,916
Why do I have to? I do not understand how it can be done.

82
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:48,752
I am a good father for my one daughter. I'm being a good father of two daughters.

83
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,500
Stop it. - What?

84
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:55,624
You are not a good father. - Your finger to you. Yes I am.

85
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:57,584
Okay, just believe it.

86
00:05:57,752 --> 00:06:01,332
Before you know it, Stella is a tween who hate you.

87
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,792
It is your own fault. You let her play with the dildo because you are a bad father.

88
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,376
We are good parents. Your shit is not to go beyond me.

89
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:14,084
Thank God I get a boy. Girls are fucking hard.

90
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:17,416
What are you talking about? - It is easier with the boys.

91
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:21,752
When a boy is sex, it's fat. When a girl gets sex, it's bad.

92
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,792
No. - Do your daughter well have sex?

93
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,332
"Hey, Jimmy. Stella is just was fucked. Come and drink some beers.

94
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:39,500
WELCOME, NEW STUDENTS!

95
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,624
WOULD YOU HAVE FRIENDS?

96
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,460
SISTERS FOR LIFE?

97
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,668
SEARCH PHI LAMBDA!

98
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,084
Welcome to Phi Lambda.

99
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,584
It is an exciting year. If you are lucky -

100
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:07,000
- And gets busy, you become a member of a sisterhood and make friends for life.

101
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:10,876
We have installed a hot tub.

102
00:07:11,044 --> 00:07:13,460
We have brand new feather duvets.

103
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:17,708
We have a new chef, and all food is gluten-free.

104
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:23,084
Hello. What are you doing?

105
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,668
I would clearly have offered you the first. Pardon.

106
00:07:28,832 --> 00:07:32,168
Pecking order. You must have the first boom.

107
00:07:32,332 --> 00:07:35,708
No, we do not smoke joints. Never. Turn it off.

108
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:37,208
Glass.

109
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,752
Glass. - It cost $ 12.

110
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,500
There is hash oil in it. - Glass.

111
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:51,084
Your party must suck the meanest ass if you do not have to smoke pot.

112
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:54,792
The girls' student associations should not hold celebrations.

113
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,584
Seriously? - Girls Association Doctors must not keep partying.

114
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:04,916
It's only boys who can hold celebrations. Check it.

115
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:10,876
What? Fester not you?

116
00:08:11,044 --> 00:08:15,084
Of course, you dolt. We just do it with the boys.

117
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,832
Hello. - Hi.

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,544
I'm sorry if I interrupted you. - I do not know anyone.

119
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,876
I read just some old text messages.

120
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:34,252
I did too. I had not got any.

121
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,584
Looking Phi Lambda? - Yes, I'm Beth.

122
00:08:37,752 --> 00:08:41,460
Shelby. - It is exciting. First boy celebration.

123
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:44,876
Yes of course. Clear...

124
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:47,332
Drop a tier in the bucket.

125
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,876
Hello. A tier in the bucket. - Okay.

126
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:52,124
You're okay. Just go.

127
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:54,084
No. - That's all I have.

128
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:56,124
No. Uninvited guest! - Thank you!

129
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:02,376
NO MEANS YES

130
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:03,752
Damn, slut.

131
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:20,544
The room is the one big arrow pointing upstairs where they can fuck us.

132
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,000
Holy shit.

133
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,960
So what? Do you upstairs?

134
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:33,168
Who you ask? - It does not really matter.

135
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:35,416
No. - Allows you?

136
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:40,624
It was not what I had expected. - Bummer.

137
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:46,124
They play the same song over and over again. - Yes. It is piss annoying.

138
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,752
Hi, I'm Nora. - Yes ...

139
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,000
We progresses. - Yes.

140
00:09:51,368 --> 00:09:56,616
How cool, I found you. Taber Fest. I thought they were funny.

141
00:09:56,784 --> 00:10:00,908
Yes. I did not feel safe. - There was a rape mood.

142
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:04,408
To be honest, I have never taken drugs before.

143
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:07,824
But college is about new experiences, and now I'm here.

144
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:10,368
And now I smoke pot.

145
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:13,824
Not too much.

146
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:16,200
Okay, it's a great lung.

147
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:20,868
Are you okay? - Do you want some water?

148
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:24,992
I think she should Orle.

149
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,952
If she ørler, I do it too.

150
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:32,576
You are beautiful. - She's fine.

151
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:34,824
This is just me.

152
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:38,492
Smoke never in school? - What were you doing?

153
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:44,616
Have I not told? I have been in a steady relationship since third grade.

154
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:47,700
Just like Cory and Topanga?

155
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,408
Stop! - Yes exactly.

156
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:54,076
That is so sweet. - Yes, exactly.

157
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:58,824
I've loved with three men. Two of them were black.

158
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,032
And one was inside.

159
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,532
I've tried it all, but ...

160
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,576
But what? - Everything except just the one thing.

161
00:11:11,824 --> 00:11:14,576
Have you never licked ass on a guy?

162
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,576
No no. I think...

163
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:22,700
Highschool was bummer. Now that we are honest.

164
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:25,576
My father wanted me home early.

165
00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:30,700
He gave me a rape whistle and talk about behavior on the way here.

166
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:36,616
Therefore I had not the wild social life, when I was in highschool.

167
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:40,368
You do not need to say it. We are completely with.

168
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,492
Did you have any friends?

169
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,532
Knock, knock! I'll just.

170
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,576
What about girls? - Hey, Dustin.

171
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,116
It smells a little weird.

172
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:05,616
Are you done? First warning.

173
00:12:07,824 --> 00:12:09,700
It's just bullshit!

174
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:13,408
You're adults. I go to college. - You made me piss scared.

175
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:15,576
Have all of you smoked? - Yes.

176
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:18,744
Hell! I knew it fucking!

177
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:21,408
Do not take drugs.

178
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:23,952
Well? Is that understood?

179
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:27,660
See you later, tosser. Grab me if you need me.

180
00:12:27,824 --> 00:12:31,076
Frankly. - Holy shit.

181
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:35,576
I am so tired of guys who will decide for us.

182
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:38,908
We're not little girls. We are strong, adult women.

183
00:12:39,076 --> 00:12:44,616
The girls can not even hold parties. - And we can not enjoy ourselves here.

184
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:46,576
You know what we do?

185
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:51,824
We make our own fraternity, having parties that we like.

186
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:56,452
And then we sisters for life. - Yes.

187
00:12:56,616 --> 00:12:59,032
I'll be your sister. - I do too.

188
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,784
BFF!

189
00:13:01,952 --> 00:13:05,324
Did not I say that you should shut your ass?

190
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:09,232
Pokeraften!

191
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:22,108
Selfiestang.

192
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:30,692
I have designed Outback Steakhouses. Many of them.

193
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,192
However, your app will change the world. - A cock at a time.

194
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,900
"En pik ad gangen."

195
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:41,360
It's a bold idea. A photo app that makes one's dick bigger.

196
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:45,024
Your TED talk was good. - Thank you so on.

197
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:48,276
I have just successfully. - I'm still armor.

198
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:51,984
It is not the worst, but there are many rules.

199
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:56,232
I do not know why I have to go with the camera. I will not shoot myself.

200
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,900
Can not beat them, stop himself to them.

201
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:00,940
What about you?

202
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,860
Work wise it has been bummer.

203
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:09,440
They do not use models with no shirt on anymore. So now I walk around in here.

204
00:14:09,608 --> 00:14:12,232
It looks as mellow out. - And you know what?

205
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,984
I am six years older than the next oldest.

206
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:18,984
I had to take a guard for my boss because he was going to prom.

207
00:14:19,152 --> 00:14:22,984
Why is everyone in retail so young?

208
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:25,400
I feel really underrated.

209
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,484
And ... klart.

210
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:32,400
But I at least you. I love you.

211
00:14:32,568 --> 00:14:35,400
Delta Psi. - Once a week. Every Monday.

212
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:39,440
Exactly. - Well, Darren. What puts you?

213
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:43,776
I put ... it all.

214
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,276
A good hand. What do you have? Full house? - Hopefully one day.

215
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,192
Holy shit. Our song. What happens?

216
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,776
Oh God.

217
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,024
Oh God.

218
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:22,608
The Greeks said that all of it is half of a whole.

219
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:25,816
Peter, you're the half that makes me whole.

220
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:28,276
Oh god, it happens really?

221
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,152
I do not know the rules about who should be free.

222
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:34,776
You go anyway not ring.

223
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,400
But wear it for my sake.

224
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:41,276
Will you marry me? - Yes, why not! Give it on.

225
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,732
1, 2, 3!

226
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,360
USA!

227
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:55,732
Has he told you about college? It was wild.

228
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,108
He was too ill. He tufted all the girls.

229
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:03,276
No. - You were a little crazy.

230
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,276
I would just figure it out. - While wading in pussy.

231
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,776
It was not ... - I licked all too pussy.

232
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:13,940
Not as much as him.

233
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:18,692
That's okay, we just talk about our commune?

234
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,816
Darren could just move into. He is here almost every night.

235
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,276
Thank you.

236
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,692
Seriously, it's okay that Darren will move into -

237
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,360
- And you stop to stay here?

238
00:16:35,524 --> 00:16:39,608
What do you mean? Why? - We're engaged.

239
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:42,192
What had you imagined?

240
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,024
That you would stay in your room and that I would stay at mine. To our dying day.

241
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:50,608
Darren're working from home -

242
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:55,068
- So we had intended to turn it into an office.

243
00:16:55,232 --> 00:16:58,360
And maybe one day ...

244
00:16:58,524 --> 00:17:01,524
... A children's room.

245
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:03,608
Babies are small. - Yes.

246
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:06,652
They are the size of a small shoe box.

247
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:10,984
They do not take up a whole room. - I try to find a counterargument.

248
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:15,152
It was damn fun. I just took the piss out of you.

249
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:19,108
I must get out for a run. - Now?

250
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:23,192
I love you damn. Come here.

251
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,984
Love you. - You too.

252
00:17:26,152 --> 00:17:30,152
Teddy, do not just wear shoes?

253
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,900
The owner of the house is super cool. He's like me.

254
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:45,692
He is sweaty. I can do everything I want.

255
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,068
Keeping parties, stay up all night -

256
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:51,816
- Play with your phones and snap chat all the shit.

257
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:55,400
Smoking pot. But did you afford it? What's your name?

258
00:17:55,568 --> 00:17:57,984
Shelby. - I'm Team Shelby.

259
00:17:58,152 --> 00:17:59,860
And you? - Nora.

260
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:03,316
I am Team Nora. What? - Beth.

261
00:18:03,484 --> 00:18:05,192
Yes it is good.

262
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,692
Usually it costs 25,000 a month, but I can get it for the 5000th

263
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,732
Can I put 5 kg? - No.

264
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:16,360
My phone rings. Moment.

265
00:18:16,524 --> 00:18:17,732
Called the?

266
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,860
I'll get it right. These are some others who want to start a girl Association.

267
00:18:22,984 --> 00:18:26,484
They are very alternative. What should I do?

268
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:29,860
What do we do? - We can not afford.

269
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:33,732
What do we do? - Do not look at me.

270
00:18:34,524 --> 00:18:38,652
There sits a beautiful centaur and thinking.

271
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:42,732
Who are you? - I'm Teddy Sanders.

272
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:46,024
I have lived here.

273
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,816
Why hobble you? - I ran here without shoes on.

274
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:52,360
Very far.

275
00:18:52,524 --> 00:18:55,192
Are you considering renting the house? - Maybe.

276
00:18:55,316 --> 00:18:58,732
What do you mean by that? - We will start an association.

277
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:04,940
Without the system. Where you can do as you like and keep the wildest celebrations.

278
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:07,652
En pigeforening, der holder fester?
- Kappa Nu.

279
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:11,732
What's wrong with the boy celebrations? - Everything.

280
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,108
We stayed in some great parties here. Beggars and flax.

281
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:20,652
Directors and koncernhoer. Fresh guys and provinshoer.

282
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:25,024
They are super sexist. The theme is always ho.

283
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:28,984
I mean ... Oh god.

284
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,816
Oh no. Oh God.

285
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:38,732
I see what you mean. - It does not matter right now.

286
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,984
We have to find something else. We can not afford housing.

287
00:19:43,152 --> 00:19:45,276
How much money do you have?

288
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,652
Perhaps a few thousand, if we throw everything. But it is for the whole year.

289
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:55,192
Use them on payment and hold one shooting day.

290
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,440
I get membership fees and an army that earns money for you.

291
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:00,984
And then you get your union.

292
00:20:01,152 --> 00:20:03,192
Have you had a rental agreement?

293
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,316
I did not understand some of what you said.

294
00:20:07,484 --> 00:20:09,692
Last week I slept in a bunk bed.

295
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,192
Yes, and I can not boil an egg.

296
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,900
We are 18. We know what we want but not how to achieve it.

297
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:21,908
I drove Delta Psi in four years. I can help you.

298
00:20:22,076 --> 00:20:23,116
Okay.

299
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:28,240
I mean ... Can I use it for anything?

300
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:32,160
Yes, we can really use for anything.

301
00:20:32,324 --> 00:20:34,576
Believe In It?

302
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,532
It should be celebrated. - Yes!

303
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,824
Okay! - Shall we take a ride on the cable car?

304
00:20:39,992 --> 00:20:43,076
Tear it up. - Now I just watch.

305
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,700
We would do two at a time. Try to see. Delta Psi!

306
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:52,952
Did anything happen? - I'm fine.

307
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:55,492
The booklets I am not.

308
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
We'll take it.

309
00:20:57,868 --> 00:20:59,952
Sweaty.

310
00:21:00,116 --> 00:21:02,660
He you okay? - Yes.

311
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:06,116
I am up and running. The house is perfect for us.

312
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:07,660
It becomes fat.

313
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:09,452
See you. - Thank you.

314
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,660
Is it Teddy Sanders?

315
00:21:11,824 --> 00:21:13,616
Pis. - Who is it?

316
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:16,240
Drive. I'll explain later.

317
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,784
Mac, Kelly. Hello. So what? - So what?

318
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:25,408
What are you doing here? I live here. - Yes. Who was it?

319
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,700
You must not think of. - Okay.

320
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:30,824
Well, I see you move. - We're moving up.

321
00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:33,992
It could have done when I lived here.

322
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,952
It would be grease. - That we were not ready.

323
00:21:37,116 --> 00:21:39,700
I am punished because of you two.

324
00:21:41,492 --> 00:21:45,116
Beware! - It's hard to get work.

325
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,032
Hard. - Yes.

326
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,492
What are you doing here? - It will find out soon enough.

327
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,740
What does that mean? - It should not think about.

328
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:58,324
It was good to see the lines. I've missed jer. See you soon.

329
00:21:58,492 --> 00:21:59,992
Okay, hi.

330
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,660
It was as weird.

331
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:17,992
Do you want to be included in the coolest 
girl association? So it is here.

332
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,492
Welcome to Kappa Nu!

333
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,992
Welcome, new students!

334
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,284
Vi er Kappa Nu!

335
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:30,740
Do you have friends for life?

336
00:22:30,908 --> 00:22:31,616
Substances!

337
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,740
Join!

338
00:22:35,952 --> 00:22:36,952
Hot guy!

339
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:44,532
What the hell...

340
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:49,952
People. - Are there some who move into?

341
00:22:50,116 --> 00:22:54,452
Can we just get past, girls? Hello. - Hi.

342
00:22:54,616 --> 00:22:57,368
What the hell ... - What's happening here?

343
00:22:57,532 --> 00:22:59,824
"Så er det nu, Kappa Nu."

344
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:03,616
Hi! We are your neighbors. Mac and Kelly.

345
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:07,740
I Kelly. - Are your parents here?

346
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:11,908
No. Meet girls from Kappa Nu. - What is it?

347
00:23:12,076 --> 00:23:15,616
That's our girl unification.

348
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:20,740
Hello, neighbors!

349
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:25,916
You want a beer or a mocktail? A mother-mocktail? Congratulations.

350
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:29,832
I would like to have a mocktail. - Insert the woman a mocktail.

351
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,832
Thanks. - Thank you.

352
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:36,832
What the hell ...! - What do we do?

353
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,168
I have no idea! Buyers will damn not live next to a girl Association.

354
00:23:42,332 --> 00:23:44,708
Is it now, I'll freak out? - No.

355
00:23:44,876 --> 00:23:46,084
Should I cry? - No.

356
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:52,084
We must get them to take it easy. - They just behave.

357
00:23:52,252 --> 00:23:54,460
No parties during the withdrawal period.

358
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,000
Afterwards, they just go crazy.

359
00:23:57,344 --> 00:24:00,344
Hello. So what?

360
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:02,716
Can we just take a quick word?

361
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:04,884
We will ask you something.

362
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:10,008
We just sold our house with a 30-day cooling-off period.

363
00:24:10,176 --> 00:24:14,260
If something happens that scares buyers away -

364
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:16,844
- We are faced with two houses and is on the ass.

365
00:24:17,008 --> 00:24:21,176
So it would be cool if I took it quietly -

366
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:24,424
- And did not hold celebrations for 30 days.

367
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:26,592
So we are away. Then you can go crazy.

368
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,760
A very large part of the reason -

369
00:24:31,924 --> 00:24:35,132
- We made the association, was -

370
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:40,632
- The boy associations may well hold celebrations, but the girl's associations can not do.

371
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,676
Is that right? - Why does festivities lot to us.

372
00:24:44,844 --> 00:24:48,676
I would probably like to see your daughter have the same rights as the guys.

373
00:24:49,884 --> 00:24:53,924
I like man only agree with you.

374
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:57,300
I can only support your cause.

375
00:24:57,468 --> 00:25:00,424
But my wife has made a few thoughts on -

376
00:25:00,592 --> 00:25:04,552
- How you can approach it in a different way. Kelly?

377
00:25:05,752 --> 00:25:06,792
Drive.

378
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,544
We may well find a compromise, right?

379
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:15,460
I ... - There I was told no! What, then, neighbors?

380
00:25:15,624 --> 00:25:17,960
Teddy? - Welcome to "soon".

381
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:23,708
What do you mean? - I said: It will find out soon enough.

382
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:25,916
It took place shown only in your head.

383
00:25:26,084 --> 00:25:28,124
I am mentor for the association.

384
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:30,292
Can you be? - Yes.

385
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,084
Why are you doing it? - Why flying butterflies?

386
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:39,208
In order to gather nectar. - Well, I only know what I do.

387
00:25:39,332 --> 00:25:42,292
And I ensure that there can be partied in the house.

388
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,084
What? - So let's makse it out!

389
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:53,708
I've missed jer.

390
00:25:55,544 --> 00:25:58,792
The rules for successful girl unification. Rule no. 1:

391
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,916
Use the money forehead to keep track of the cash.

392
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:05,000
5 cans per month is enough for rent.

393
00:26:05,168 --> 00:26:10,668
Rule no. 2: Embrace new applicants. You can dress them like idiots.

394
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:14,460
Minion. - They have a whole army of Minions fun.

395
00:26:14,624 --> 00:26:17,960
I love Minions and now they force me to hate them.

396
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:26,500
Rule no. 3: Hold celebrations that shows who you are.

397
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:31,168
Hillary Clinton, Jeanne d'Arc commands you to send jointen on.

398
00:26:31,332 --> 00:26:34,668
First Lady Clinton? - Or Senator Clinton?

399
00:26:34,832 --> 00:26:36,916
Or future President Clinton?

400
00:26:37,084 --> 00:26:41,208
Oprah, we need beer. - Look under your chairs.

401
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:45,208
There is beer for everyone!

402
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:48,624
Beer to you, beer for you, beer for you!

403
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:50,252
I love you, Oprah.

404
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:53,792
Are sweet dampen you? - Shut up!

405
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,332
MOVIE NIGHT

406
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,752
"A tear in the sky"

407
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:58,624
I am so grateful.

408
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:04,124
I just love you so much.

409
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,168
It's unfair. You're too young.

410
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,168
SHELBY lose your virginity-FEST

411
00:27:19,124 --> 00:27:22,876
Please just shut up! - Stop now!

412
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:26,544
Come on, everyone! We want pussy!

413
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:30,624
We want pussy!

414
00:27:34,668 --> 00:27:36,168
Come on. - We beg!

415
00:27:36,332 --> 00:27:41,544
I can not let a girl association that tries to be independent.

416
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:44,876
It's a PR nightmare. - Why?

417
00:27:45,044 --> 00:27:50,044
For example: "Sexist female dean closes girl unification."

418
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,792
It is inversely sexism. And it is in itself sexist.

419
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,084
Conversely sexism does not exist, white man.

420
00:28:00,252 --> 00:28:04,208
How should you not speak to me. I am jew. I belong to a minority.

421
00:28:04,376 --> 00:28:08,208
There are fewer of you, like with labradoodler.

422
00:28:08,376 --> 00:28:13,208
After three warnings must be closed. - You can get tons of warnings.

423
00:28:13,376 --> 00:28:16,668
I can see that we do not follow the rules.

424
00:28:16,832 --> 00:28:18,332
Plan B.

425
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:23,332
We hope this translates in that you change your mind.

426
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,124
Do we have a deal, rector? - No.

427
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,960
The finger to you! - Give the gas tax.

428
00:28:33,124 --> 00:28:36,960
Do you speak such in front of your daughter? - We're good parents.

429
00:28:37,124 --> 00:28:40,084
She can not remember shit. - Jo.

430
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:43,668
Nej. Se her. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

431
00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:44,916
Fuck.

432
00:28:46,084 --> 00:28:48,168
Ser hun "Goodfellas"?

433
00:28:48,332 --> 00:28:52,084
It is you who are fools. I do not know what she sees.

434
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:56,376
What should we do? The house must be reviewed.

435
00:28:56,544 --> 00:28:58,832
The buyers can come and say:

436
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,544
"There are a few leaks, and so live there 20 psychopathic teenagers next door."

437
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,000
We have two houses. - As we lose.

438
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:10,000
And then we're screwed. - We are totally screwed. Hey darling.

439
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:13,332
We must of them. - I could not talk to the girls.

440
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,124
The boys we could talk to. They looked at us as if we were their grandparents.

441
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:20,832
Yes. How to become Stella not.

442
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,624
She will always be our best friend. - We're a team.

443
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:28,708
Not too, Stella? Come over here. - Come.

444
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:35,084
Do you want to come here? - What the hell's wrong with her?

445
00:29:35,252 --> 00:29:39,792
Play with your toys, baby. - Play with your toys. Give it a kiss.

446
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,044
Who listens to young people? Their parents. - The known. Their parents.

447
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,624
So what?! Hi Dad.

448
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:53,000
You should stay on a college and not in a dilapidated villa.

449
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:56,376
If you want to stay as a vagabond murderer?

450
00:29:56,544 --> 00:30:00,084
I can do what I want here. That's the whole point of college.

451
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:02,876
When are you starting to speak like Eminem?

452
00:30:03,044 --> 00:30:05,792
Here's how I talk. It's ridiculous.

453
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
How old is the pizza?

454
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:10,832
East he muggen. - East he mug.

455
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,460
I eat it whenever I want. - Have you inherited mit dummegen?

456
00:30:15,624 --> 00:30:18,460
Have you learned to be as dumb as boys?

457
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,792
Back to college. - No! I've chosen to live like this.

458
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,584
I would only stay in Kappa Nu.

459
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:30,500
My little girl is growing up.

460
00:30:32,044 --> 00:30:33,044
Thank you Father.

461
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:38,376
Should I invite you and your friends at brunch?

462
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:42,332
I need a pair of jeans. - Then we go out and shop.

463
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,744
How did it go? - Are they all right now? Punished them?

464
00:30:46,908 --> 00:30:50,992
I did my best, but it did not. - What do you mean?

465
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,992
You can get them all, when they are two.

466
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,244
Yes. - It's getting harder.

467
00:30:56,408 --> 00:30:58,868
I do not understand a word of what she says.

468
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:04,408
But it was good to see her. It's so quiet at home without her.

469
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,868
I manage it.

470
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:13,452
What a beautiful girl.

471
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:18,032
Can I hold her? - No, no, no. You do not have to.

472
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,824
Is that a dildo dressed as a princess? - No.

473
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:24,492
It is an af vor time popular cartoon characters.

474
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,824
Thank you for trying.

475
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,908
Called in to my parents?

476
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,460
Yes, we did. - Yes, we did actually.

477
00:31:35,624 --> 00:31:39,460
Did I? - It is about 30 days.

478
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:45,024
In 30 days, the withdrawal period is over! - More we do not ask.

479
00:31:45,492 --> 00:31:49,868
Then there is the war. - No. Why should there be war?

480
00:31:49,932 --> 00:31:53,852
There is a war. - We started it and we calls off it.

481
00:31:54,016 --> 00:31:55,976
There is a war.

482
00:31:57,224 --> 00:31:59,724
Hey, Mac! - Hey, Big Mac!

483
00:32:01,976 --> 00:32:04,352
Although! There has moved more into.

484
00:32:04,516 --> 00:32:08,432
In staying you illegally on private property.

485
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,024
Beth must have some sunscreen on. - She performs shown.

486
00:32:13,624 --> 00:32:16,044
Where are you going? - Leave me alone.

487
00:32:19,524 --> 00:32:20,944
Where am I?!

488
00:32:25,184 --> 00:32:27,600
Oh no. I have killed a girl.

489
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:33,324
I'm on painkillers, your bastard! Kappa Nu!

490
00:32:33,532 --> 00:32:35,576
What the hell's wrong with you ?!

491
00:32:44,492 --> 00:32:46,160
Get out, you beast!

492
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:49,492
It does not work! You just makes them more sexy!

493
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:55,324
I do not like it!

494
00:32:57,284 --> 00:32:59,076
What was it? - A bird?

495
00:33:05,032 --> 00:33:07,368
What the hell is that?

496
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:13,660
No! - Tampons! Where is it gross.

497
00:33:13,824 --> 00:33:16,324
Hold så op, I Udyr!

498
00:33:16,492 --> 00:33:18,200
Hold op!
- Mac!

499
00:33:18,368 --> 00:33:20,200
The second window is open!

500
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,744
It was really fun. Where did the theater blood from?

501
00:33:27,908 --> 00:33:30,492
From our scabbards. - Was it real?

502
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,324
It was shot out of our wombs.

503
00:33:33,492 --> 00:33:35,324
Have just thrown ...

504
00:33:35,532 --> 00:33:37,824
It's crazy obnoxious.

505
00:33:39,908 --> 00:33:42,952
Why did you do it? There you went too far.

506
00:33:43,116 --> 00:33:46,452
You are supersexistisk. It was skidesjovt.

507
00:33:46,616 --> 00:33:51,868
You had thought it would be fun if it had been a bag of dicks.

508
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:54,032
No...

509
00:33:56,908 --> 00:33:59,076
A bag of dicks.

510
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:04,700
Okay, that got me. It is fun.

511
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:06,908
A bag of dicks.

512
00:34:07,076 --> 00:34:10,160
First review is tomorrow.

513
00:34:10,324 --> 00:34:13,200
We need help. - We need to get the girls away.

514
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:18,032
Between the hours of ten and five. - If buyers see the girls, it's over.

515
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,660
The girls are far-fetched. They are from another planet.

516
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:24,616
Yes, they are worse than the guys. - Brainstorming.

517
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:26,868
A variant of a classic:

518
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,952
Flax before guys. - No.

519
00:34:30,116 --> 00:34:33,200
It will not work. We always flax first.

520
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:37,576
It worked with the boys. - Girls are much smarter than guys.

521
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:43,576
It is sexism! - No, not when it's on fire.

522
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:46,616
I do not know what sexism is. - Men's rights.

523
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:50,700
Fuck you. - Why claws in you?

524
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:54,952
Do you have touched poison ivy? - No. We've got bed bugs.

525
00:34:55,076 --> 00:34:56,660
Add! No!

526
00:34:56,824 --> 00:35:01,452
Need to make me embarrassed? - Do not embarrass us!

527
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:05,868
We have mastered it. We disinfect the house and stay away for three days.

528
00:35:09,824 --> 00:35:14,200
The clothes are full of bedbugs. - Quiet! They will be infected in a hurry.

529
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:16,616
Here are some new members.

530
00:35:16,784 --> 00:35:20,700
Those are my favorite jeans. - I shit on. In with them.

531
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,952
I can not see shit. - There are many lice in the sheets.

532
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:27,952
I can feel them! Get it off!

533
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:37,552
Good morning! Now we come in. Take clothes.

534
00:35:37,716 --> 00:35:42,424
Hi! Welcome. It's good to see you.

535
00:35:42,592 --> 00:35:44,216
Welcome back.

536
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:46,908
I have taken my guy.

537
00:35:47,076 --> 00:35:50,824
No, he must see if here is fungus. - Do you think this is fungus?

538
00:35:50,992 --> 00:35:57,032
Here smelled weird lately. - We just want to be on the safe side.

539
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,992
Cloudy. That's why we're here. - What's happening over there? New tenants?

540
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:07,076
Yes, the new family is starting to disinfect. A nice, quiet family.

541
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:10,616
There must be a large family.

542
00:36:10,784 --> 00:36:14,368
Yes. - It is a very religious family.

543
00:36:14,532 --> 00:36:17,532
They are Jews and very sweet.

544
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,660
Why did you do that? - Well, they are cute.

545
00:36:20,524 --> 00:36:24,700
I actually think they get there. See! It is our Jewish neighbors.

546
00:36:24,868 --> 00:36:27,616
Proof that they exist.

547
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:33,484
She is pregnant. - She has a small jew in the oven.

548
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,400
Let's see if there are sponge. - Come into your home.

549
00:36:38,568 --> 00:36:40,984
We begin in your kitchen.

550
00:36:41,152 --> 00:36:43,232
Here's weird. - Yes.

551
00:36:50,524 --> 00:36:52,984
Where do you live, Teddy?

552
00:36:54,484 --> 00:36:57,568
I help some girls to make an association.

553
00:36:57,732 --> 00:37:02,860
They live in our house. I'm moving in enough. It is a great achievement for me.

554
00:37:05,444 --> 00:37:09,692
Okay ... It's super weird. - No, it's super normal.

555
00:37:10,484 --> 00:37:13,732
If it makes you happy ... - You stay out!

556
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,732
Relax, Teddy.

557
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,400
Now I've finally found something I'm good at and then criticize me?

558
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:23,608
I just think that it is a little odd -

559
00:37:23,776 --> 00:37:27,524
- That an adult man is to found a girl Association.

560
00:37:27,692 --> 00:37:32,444
Girls have no right to throw a party. - It is not a right.

561
00:37:32,608 --> 00:37:37,108
Yes it is. Bak me up, Garf. - Keep me out.

562
00:37:37,276 --> 00:37:41,152
I am your best friend. I'm just trying to be honest.

563
00:37:41,316 --> 00:37:44,316
It was you a long time. - What?

564
00:37:44,444 --> 00:37:47,816
You did not tell me your secret, while we were in college.

565
00:37:47,984 --> 00:37:50,568
What's happening to you?

566
00:37:50,732 --> 00:37:55,484
You said it to Garf first! - Yes, he experimented with guys.

567
00:37:55,652 --> 00:38:00,568
Sometimes you have to suck dick to discover that you do not like dick.

568
00:38:00,732 --> 00:38:05,108
You're just angry because you're lost. The rest of us have moved on.

569
00:38:05,276 --> 00:38:08,984
Garf's armor, Scoonie has his own company, I'm getting married.

570
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:13,152
And you move into the girl unification of hell.

571
00:38:16,652 --> 00:38:21,944
The sisters are better brothers to me than you. You're not my brother.

572
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:27,360
Do not say anything you can not take in you again. Guys before flax.

573
00:38:27,524 --> 00:38:31,652
Do not call them flax. It's not working anymore.

574
00:38:36,396 --> 00:38:39,976
We need to talk about our economy. It does not look good.

575
00:38:40,144 --> 00:38:45,020
Fumigation was animals. We have only two buckets back. What should we do?

576
00:38:45,184 --> 00:38:48,976
Our Minions can make money for us. - They have enough to do.

577
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,852
Maranda, sell your brother not pot?

578
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,436
Yes, it was what I said. My brother, Daffodil.

579
00:39:02,604 --> 00:39:07,768
Why do not we buy pot for all our money and sell it for outdoor party?

580
00:39:07,936 --> 00:39:11,976
Yes, dammit! - We can score box.

581
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:15,184
Good idea. We write Kappa Nu with glitter on our T-shirts.

582
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:18,268
Bad idea. You can not serve enough of it.

583
00:39:18,436 --> 00:39:21,520
What? - All sell pot to the party.

584
00:39:21,684 --> 00:39:26,896
We sit on potmarkedet by gossiping about all the other drug dealers in the city.

585
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:32,396
And then Kappa Now the only group that sells pot to the party.

586
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,144
Hell, yes! - It's fucking brilliant!

587
00:39:36,312 --> 00:39:39,060
Look here. It is very risky.

588
00:39:39,228 --> 00:39:40,312
We sell ... - Pot!

589
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:42,144
We smoke ... - Pot!

590
00:39:42,312 --> 00:39:44,268
What do we sell? - Pot!

591
00:39:44,436 --> 00:39:47,020
Hell!

592
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,728
You behave like children. Now I listen.

593
00:39:49,896 --> 00:39:52,520
I've tried it. I know what I'm doing.

594
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:54,644
I have no knowledge ...

595
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:57,852
What happens to Teddy? He seems angry.

596
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:01,560
Has he got quarter life crisis? It is what it is.

597
00:40:01,728 --> 00:40:04,144
We drop him. It is a shame.

598
00:40:04,312 --> 00:40:09,312
Yes, but it's for his own good. But he's so delicious.

599
00:40:09,436 --> 00:40:13,560
Yes, but it's for his own good. How about others?

600
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:18,268
It sucks, but yes. You're right.

601
00:40:18,436 --> 00:40:22,852
Am I right? - We voted on it. You must leave.

602
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,060
When? - Right now. With our phones.

603
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:31,060
What? No. It can not do this to me.

604
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:34,520
I thought we were sisters. Should not we be a team?

605
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:37,520
Why do you do it? It can not do this to me.

606
00:40:37,684 --> 00:40:40,684
I have quit my job. - That we asked you to leave early.

607
00:40:40,852 --> 00:40:43,644
I have raised my annuity. - What is it?

608
00:40:43,812 --> 00:40:48,396
I do not know ... now. - I'm glad your help.

609
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,852
We have folded their wings and fly like women.

610
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,728
I have only you. Are we in this together?

611
00:40:54,896 --> 00:40:59,436
You are not like us, man. You are old.

612
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:07,436
You are right. I've played on the wrong team.

613
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:11,604
See you.

614
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,896
Okay...

615
00:41:18,244 --> 00:41:22,076
I was not too hard on him, right?

616
00:41:22,244 --> 00:41:25,328
No, no, you did well.

617
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,328
It was good.

618
00:41:29,496 --> 00:41:34,120
Now that dad is not here anymore, are we on a rampage.

619
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:42,196
Is the emergency services? I want to report three places -

620
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,276
- Which sells marijuana. Yes, ganja.

621
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,152
Down on the floor! - Down!

622
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,152
Take it in your mouth! Yes, do you like!

623
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,904
What are you doing, Watkins? - Today you are with to learn.

624
00:41:58,776 --> 00:42:01,904
Ned!

625
00:42:02,068 --> 00:42:05,152
What the hell ...! - You do not go to police school anymore!

626
00:42:06,444 --> 00:42:11,820
Ned ... Sorry. I'll have to go to the station.

627
00:42:11,984 --> 00:42:16,152
We have bottled water in the car. We can buy some food on the way.

628
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,860
Think that we made it through. - Thank God.

629
00:42:20,028 --> 00:42:24,568
Yes, dammit! - It's over, if they see the girls.

630
00:42:24,736 --> 00:42:27,276
I rush totally over it.

631
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:31,320
I need to chill with a joint, but my drug dealer has nothing.

632
00:42:31,484 --> 00:42:33,776
Good luck finding anything. - Hell!

633
00:42:33,944 --> 00:42:37,236
How did you get in? - It does not matter.

634
00:42:37,404 --> 00:42:40,568
I will help you to stop the girl unification.

635
00:42:40,736 --> 00:42:42,904
Yes, I change side.

636
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:45,528
Sweet! - Yes!

637
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:49,304
I am also still fresh, Kelly. - Oh hold up.

638
00:42:49,468 --> 00:42:52,384
It hurts me, although I should not fuck.

639
00:42:52,552 --> 00:42:55,712
He just kidding. - Kappa Nu set at potmarkedet.

640
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:58,828
Oh no! - Oh yeah.

641
00:42:58,896 --> 00:43:02,976
No other vendor pot before Monday. - Will they sell to me?

642
00:43:04,244 --> 00:43:07,076
Nej. De har tre kilo pot.

643
00:43:07,204 --> 00:43:11,368
They can sell it for $ 50 program if they want to.

644
00:43:11,536 --> 00:43:16,784
That's $ 16,000 half a kilo. If they sell it all, they get 112,000.

645
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,968
It shall we do. - You are good at math.

646
00:43:20,136 --> 00:43:23,176
No, but I'm good pot. - It's the same.

647
00:43:23,344 --> 00:43:27,052
No, this is pot. - Just play, it's meat. Try.

648
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,012
Why should I buy meat? - Because you're hungry.

649
00:43:30,176 --> 00:43:32,552
Do you think burgers? - Steaks.

650
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,428
How much does a gram steaks? Why should I sell steaks in grams?

651
00:43:36,596 --> 00:43:39,928
Fine. - They will sell it for outdoor party.

652
00:43:40,096 --> 00:43:42,844
They get enough cooling-off period.

653
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:47,304
What should we do? - Stealing it. So they do not have to rent.

654
00:43:47,468 --> 00:43:50,968
Their members go to other associations and then it's over.

655
00:43:51,136 --> 00:43:55,176
What do you get out? - I would honestly just appreciated.

656
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:58,844
How the hell do we beat them? They are 15th

657
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:03,260
No. They are 15 individuals. They have no unity.

658
00:44:03,428 --> 00:44:08,176
They forget the most important rule: There is no aces in the "community".

659
00:44:08,344 --> 00:44:11,176
Yes, there are two. - There is actually only one.

660
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:13,304
No. - Yes, in the middle.

661
00:44:13,468 --> 00:44:16,344
It is an L. - The two s's are around.

662
00:44:16,512 --> 00:44:20,052
F-æ-l-s-e-s-l-e-s-k-a-b.

663
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,096
What? - I forget the P.

664
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:28,676
F-æ-l-l-e-s-k-a-p-a-t...

665
00:44:28,844 --> 00:44:30,928
Fælleskapat? - Yes.

666
00:44:31,096 --> 00:44:33,804
Is teat so dumb? - Now we have come out on the wrong track.

667
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:38,260
We need to find out how we can infiltrate the outdoor party.

668
00:44:38,428 --> 00:44:41,012
Outdoor Fest? - Outdoor Fest.

669
00:44:41,176 --> 00:44:43,720
Outdoor Fest. - Outdoor Fest.

670
00:45:21,676 --> 00:45:24,428
Potkage!

671
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:28,344
Pot for women. Only 20 dollars.

672
00:45:28,512 --> 00:45:32,928
Kappa Nu-pot. It is charity spot. - Potkage. Only 20 dollars a piece.

673
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,136
You are fucking scary to look at. - People love clowns.

674
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,512
Hell! - Do not do that!

675
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:47,052
You do not again. So I just give birth.

676
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,428
Here's the plan. I go up on stage and dance.

677
00:45:51,596 --> 00:45:55,428
I'll distract the girls, while Mac runs to steal the pot.

678
00:45:55,896 --> 00:45:58,312
Kelly and Paula, are driving getaway cars.

679
00:45:58,476 --> 00:46:01,644
I am pregnant and can not run around here.

680
00:46:01,812 --> 00:46:05,560
I do not think all the girls get distracted when you're dancing.

681
00:46:05,728 --> 00:46:09,060
They do usually. - I do not even know where we are.

682
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:11,104
Okay. I'm ready.

683
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:17,020
Shit! Hell! No!

684
00:46:17,184 --> 00:46:19,184
I have no baby oil.

685
00:46:19,352 --> 00:46:23,476
It is crucial. Baby Oil provide two more lines.

686
00:46:23,644 --> 00:46:24,768
Vent.

687
00:46:26,476 --> 00:46:30,520
Just come. Of where it warm. It is really hot.

688
00:46:30,684 --> 00:46:34,728
It burns! Rub it in.

689
00:46:34,896 --> 00:46:37,476
Holy shit. - Oh God.

690
00:46:37,644 --> 00:46:41,268
Kelly, what the hell are you doing? - We are busy.

691
00:46:41,436 --> 00:46:43,812
Take your thighs. - Okay.

692
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:46,644
What's up! Clear stage.

693
00:46:46,812 --> 00:46:50,812
I have nothing to say. This song is for my girlfriends in Kappa Nu.

694
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:55,144
We have had some problems in the past, but I love you.

695
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:58,376
DJ, then shake ass.

696
00:46:58,544 --> 00:47:00,876
You run the store, right? - Jo.

697
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,960
Okay...

698
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,168
Oh no!

699
00:47:51,796 --> 00:47:53,796
He showed dick!

700
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,796
Oh no. - The pot!

701
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,504
It is gone! Oh no!

702
00:48:03,628 --> 00:48:07,336
The damn monkey has taken our pot! - Get hold of it!

703
00:48:08,796 --> 00:48:10,960
Get the pot!

704
00:48:12,004 --> 00:48:14,044
I hate clowns!

705
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,960
Shit! - Find another way out.

706
00:48:19,128 --> 00:48:22,128
I'll get another car. Move! - Oh no!

707
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,128
Away!

708
00:48:39,296 --> 00:48:41,336
Shit! - Move!

709
00:48:48,504 --> 00:48:49,752
I have your pot!

710
00:48:51,876 --> 00:48:55,044
Where is my pot? Come on!

711
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,584
He who laughs last! - Stop!

712
00:49:07,252 --> 00:49:11,460
It's a waste! It is not pot! - The pot!

713
00:49:11,628 --> 00:49:13,712
The clown fooled us!

714
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,252
Shit!

715
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:21,252
Wait. Mac, you can comfortably.

716
00:49:36,252 --> 00:49:37,296
Pis!

717
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,460
Right! - I athletics champion, your slut!

718
00:50:18,584 --> 00:50:20,796
Come on!

719
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,920
Hurry up!

720
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,376
Holy shit! - Now she comes!

721
00:50:31,336 --> 00:50:33,504
Free can! - Her!

722
00:50:33,668 --> 00:50:35,628
Free can!

723
00:50:35,796 --> 00:50:38,084
Pot to the people!

724
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,876
How will we pay the rent?

725
00:50:43,044 --> 00:50:45,876
Your muscles turns me on.

726
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:48,668
I pump a kilo! - Do you have pain?

727
00:50:48,836 --> 00:50:50,712
They are a little heavy. - Yes.

728
00:50:50,876 --> 00:50:53,004
I love you! Hell...

729
00:50:53,168 --> 00:50:56,668
And.

730
00:51:00,084 --> 00:51:03,836
It is a shame, but it's also pretty funny.

731
00:51:04,004 --> 00:51:06,960
Thanks, man. - The girls were wild.

732
00:51:07,128 --> 00:51:10,752
No, the girls were too wild until we got track of them.

733
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,168
I got control of them. - You can get a handle on all situations.

734
00:51:15,336 --> 00:51:19,420
For parents are wise, and children are røvdumme.

735
00:51:19,584 --> 00:51:24,712
I've figured it out. - You need to know the answer to this:

736
00:51:24,876 --> 00:51:27,796
Who is Teddy Sanders? Important questions.

737
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,044
Before I achieved something, I asked myself: "Who is Mac Radner?

738
00:51:33,212 --> 00:51:36,168
"Who are you, Kelly Dhundee?" - Is your maiden name Dundee?

739
00:51:36,336 --> 00:51:39,336
No, Dhundee. There is an H. - Just like Crocodile Dundee?

740
00:51:39,504 --> 00:51:41,504
No, it's a different name.

741
00:51:41,668 --> 00:51:43,876
Yes, but it's a bit of a coincidence.

742
00:51:44,044 --> 00:51:46,252
Crocodile Dundee.
- Nej!

743
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:50,584
No no. - You need to find out who you are.

744
00:51:50,752 --> 00:51:56,420
What are you doing today? - Yes, what is your plan of life?

745
00:51:56,584 --> 00:52:01,260
I will play on my phone and walk around until I get tired.

746
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,412
And then I lie down to sleep in my car. I think.

747
00:52:07,576 --> 00:52:12,704
It is sad. Do you want to sleep here?

748
00:52:12,868 --> 00:52:16,328
Do you have space? - You can sleep on Stella's room.

749
00:52:16,496 --> 00:52:18,660
She takes up so much.

750
00:52:18,828 --> 00:52:20,284
And.

751
00:52:23,868 --> 00:52:26,284
Thanks. - No, we say thank you.

752
00:52:26,452 --> 00:52:29,952
It means a lot to me. - Yes, but it's nothing.

753
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,952
Yes, it is.

754
00:52:33,536 --> 00:52:35,496
So.

755
00:52:36,828 --> 00:52:39,828
Thanks. Do you have more of these?

756
00:52:39,996 --> 00:52:43,912
Yes, there are plenty in the kitchen. Just go. - Is the baby food?

757
00:52:44,076 --> 00:52:46,744
Yes, so ... - Babies get good food.

758
00:52:46,912 --> 00:52:49,536
De er faith. - Bare tag.

759
00:52:55,576 --> 00:52:58,828
That is so sweet. Watch him.

760
00:52:58,996 --> 00:53:03,744
He inhaled so much potrøg that he had fallen over.

761
00:53:03,912 --> 00:53:05,160
Okay.

762
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:12,660
We have lost all our pot, and we have to pay rent. What should we do?

763
00:53:12,828 --> 00:53:16,868
I thought you stopped the old. - It's not my fault.

764
00:53:17,036 --> 00:53:21,036
I is a human female. I had to see it.

765
00:53:21,204 --> 00:53:24,036
I stood for whipped cream ... - We were together about it.

766
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:26,660
She stood for pot. You...

767
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:30,496
Stop it! Can not you see what happens?

768
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,452
That's what the old ones. They want to divide us along.

769
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,912
They know that we can not lose if we stand together.

770
00:53:38,076 --> 00:53:39,868
For we are sisters!

771
00:53:40,036 --> 00:53:42,496
Finally I belong somewhere.

772
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,620
I did not know that college could be so fat.

773
00:53:45,784 --> 00:53:49,328
I've never had so much fun, and I've been at Space Camp.

774
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:53,204
I have not slept for a week. I will not miss anything. You are so cool.

775
00:53:53,368 --> 00:53:57,328
We will always be sisters. What do you call a house united women?

776
00:53:57,496 --> 00:54:02,496
And fuck? - Nej, in pigestudenterforening.

777
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:05,284
Okay. Here's the problem.

778
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:08,160
We can not solve our problems because we are at war.

779
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,536
What should we do? - They must taste their own medicine.

780
00:54:11,704 --> 00:54:13,704
They would drive a wedge between us.

781
00:54:13,868 --> 00:54:16,204
So what do we do?

782
00:54:17,576 --> 00:54:22,496
We create a rift between them. Or is this game?

783
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:27,244
No one would say that it was the game, if you were a man.

784
00:54:27,412 --> 00:54:29,784
Exactly. Give the gas queen.

785
00:54:29,952 --> 00:54:32,912
So we do it!

786
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,496
What do you think about it?

787
00:54:38,788 --> 00:54:40,912
Come and get me, my prince.

788
00:54:41,828 --> 00:54:44,580
Come and get me. No.

789
00:54:44,704 --> 00:54:49,164
Yellow stars. What color should her dress have?

790
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,204
What happens to the water? - It boils.

791
00:54:54,328 --> 00:54:58,996
Great, right? And now the eggs in.

792
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,956
Coming eggs in the water? - Yes. Now you just watch.

793
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,664
Did you hear that?

794
00:55:03,788 --> 00:55:06,288
It is hot! - I told you so!

795
00:55:06,412 --> 00:55:11,288
I thought it was the jacuzzi-hot. - No, it's boiling hot.

796
00:55:11,412 --> 00:55:14,328
Now comes the eggs in. They must be hard boiled.

797
00:55:14,456 --> 00:55:19,204
Do not. The melt. - No, they are just hard.

798
00:55:19,328 --> 00:55:22,912
Why should they be hard? - What do you mean?

799
00:55:23,036 --> 00:55:28,164
Pasta softens it. - You've got something.

800
00:55:28,828 --> 00:55:32,120
She looks fantastic. Try to see.

801
00:55:32,244 --> 00:55:34,912
It is a beautiful color.

802
00:55:35,236 --> 00:55:38,072
I love to color.

803
00:55:38,196 --> 00:55:40,528
She is dressed very much out.

804
00:55:40,656 --> 00:55:44,528
She stands in a garden somewhere. In a dress.

805
00:55:44,856 --> 00:55:48,728
You see sometimes people I do not see?

806
00:55:48,856 --> 00:55:50,564
Just say it.

807
00:55:50,688 --> 00:55:52,936
Honey, I'm home!

808
00:55:53,064 --> 00:55:58,188
I've always wanted to say. - It is fun. I say it constantly.

809
00:55:58,312 --> 00:56:02,020
Dear Mac. It is not good for us.

810
00:56:02,144 --> 00:56:03,728
I'm out of it. From Kelly.

811
00:56:03,856 --> 00:56:07,188
What? - What's she doing? It's a joke.

812
00:56:07,312 --> 00:56:09,856
She takes the piss out of me. - It's bullshit.

813
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,480
LOL! You got me. You are funny.

814
00:56:14,936 --> 00:56:18,356
I totally freaked out about some things. Do not call.

815
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,896
It's far out! - It's moving.

816
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,064
I'll call her. - Clear.

817
00:56:24,188 --> 00:56:27,772
Pis. He is calling. - Reject the call.

818
00:56:27,896 --> 00:56:29,104
What happens?

819
00:56:29,228 --> 00:56:32,188
It is okay. - Hang up.

820
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:37,020
Just take it easy. It is not a problem.

821
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:40,228
What things? - Cases.

822
00:56:42,896 --> 00:56:47,356
What matters? - You know that.

823
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:52,936
No. - Yes you do. Stuff.

824
00:56:54,856 --> 00:56:58,520
Can not we just talk? Where are you?

825
00:56:58,644 --> 00:57:03,688
Where's she gone? - I know.

826
00:57:03,812 --> 00:57:05,936
What?

827
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:14,396
I've been up all night. I am very uneasy.

828
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,396
Send me a text message. I am uneasy.

829
00:57:21,144 --> 00:57:24,356
I am beside myself about some things. Do not call.

830
00:57:26,896 --> 00:57:29,856
What? Are you with Jimmy?

831
00:57:32,064 --> 00:57:35,144
No. And he does not say where I am.

832
00:57:35,272 --> 00:57:36,772
Jimmy...!

833
00:57:36,896 --> 00:57:40,604
Come on. I'm hungry! - I tweet. Spell straight to Trump.

834
00:57:40,728 --> 00:57:42,812
Jimmy. - Hey, I need.

835
00:57:42,836 --> 00:57:44,504
Where is he? - Who?

836
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:49,256
You are bad at lying! Where is he? - I do not know.

837
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,504
He said you'd say. Say it then.

838
00:57:52,628 --> 00:57:56,588
Hello, Kell. - Mac is gone. Jimmy knows where he is.

839
00:57:56,712 --> 00:58:00,004
However, where he is, dammit! - I do not know.

840
00:58:00,128 --> 00:58:03,796
Now you can protect him! Tell me where he is!

841
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,756
No. He is happier for you than I am.

842
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,920
You are lying! Where the hell is he? - I'm not lying.

843
00:58:10,044 --> 00:58:13,628
Why do I so ugly? - My husband is gone.

844
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:17,796
And this man knows where he is. - Say it, dammit.

845
00:58:19,172 --> 00:58:21,588
It was completely unnecessary.

846
00:58:21,712 --> 00:58:25,712
Say it. Otherwise, she says you. - He is in prison for child pornography.

847
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:28,088
What? - No. I do not know.

848
00:58:28,212 --> 00:58:32,588
No, no, no! - Call him!

849
00:58:32,712 --> 00:58:36,336
Okay! Here! Hell.

850
00:58:36,464 --> 00:58:39,336
I got an ulcer.

851
00:58:39,464 --> 00:58:44,212
Why do you Jimmys phone? 
Are you here? Are you hiding?

852
00:58:44,336 --> 00:58:46,964
I am at your office. I've been looking for you.

853
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:49,756
I have gone to meet you. 
- Where?

854
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,004
In Sydney in Australia. Outside the opera house.

855
00:58:54,128 --> 00:58:59,628
Are you in Australia? - Yes, the trip took 18 hours. What happens?

856
00:58:59,756 --> 00:59:03,796
We have been hacked! - "Kappa Nu tricked you."

857
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,336
Kappa Nu! Drillekrig! Airbags!
- Airbags!

858
00:59:08,464 --> 00:59:11,256
This is not a drill! 
Let the ass!

859
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,712
Let the ass!

860
00:59:17,664 --> 00:59:20,704
I'll take the trip over the bridge, and then I'll come home.

861
00:59:20,828 --> 00:59:23,456
The fridge is almost new.

862
00:59:26,412 --> 00:59:28,328
Cheap pensioner shit Buy something for your grandmother!

863
00:59:29,872 --> 00:59:31,620
Pensionistlort?

864
00:59:39,204 --> 00:59:41,956
"Kappa Nu steals from you."

865
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,620
Do they have stolen from us? - Shit!

866
00:59:44,744 --> 00:59:47,328
We must call the police. - We can not!

867
00:59:47,456 --> 00:59:50,912
We stole their pot! Girls are worse than the guys.

868
00:59:51,036 --> 00:59:54,204
I know that it is not feminist, but fuck it!

869
00:59:54,328 --> 00:59:59,036
They took fortunately not Stellas toys. - Stop! I have not slept for four days!

870
00:59:59,164 --> 01:00:02,496
It is three o'clock at night where I am in Australia.

871
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:04,996
We are totally screwed.

872
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,828
We are in the drug war with some teenagers. We go bankrupt.

873
01:00:08,956 --> 01:00:13,328
We have made so many bad choices. - Soon we have two girls.

874
01:00:13,456 --> 01:00:16,996
We can not even take care of one. - I am a bad parent.

875
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:19,828
No, I am. - No.

876
01:00:19,956 --> 01:00:21,912
Stop. - It's me who's bad.

877
01:00:22,036 --> 01:00:27,536
No, it's me. Last week I found her with a potkugle in the mouth.

878
01:00:27,664 --> 01:00:31,456
Indica or Sativa? - Indica. She slept nine hours in a row.

879
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:35,164
But I lost her on the head when she was six months.

880
01:00:35,288 --> 01:00:37,536
I did too. - What?

881
01:00:37,664 --> 01:00:42,620
I went to Taco Bell and forgot her. She was near death due to a gordita!

882
01:00:42,744 --> 01:00:45,912
I am a bad parent. - It's both of us.

883
01:00:52,328 --> 01:00:54,788
Oh no, it's Broker-Wendy.

884
01:00:54,912 --> 01:00:58,704
My clients prefer the offer back. - What?

885
01:00:58,828 --> 01:01:02,244
We drove by and saw Kappa Nu. - Where'd you get the name from?

886
01:01:02,372 --> 01:01:06,120
I have also gone to college. Omega Theta. "Full speed!"

887
01:01:06,244 --> 01:01:08,912
Why is he here? You are my clients.

888
01:01:09,036 --> 01:01:14,120
Because you forgot to say that there is a fraternity next door.

889
01:01:14,244 --> 01:01:17,744
Congratulations. I have hired a fool. - Close the ass.

890
01:01:17,872 --> 01:01:19,788
Close ass. - Close the ass.

891
01:01:19,912 --> 01:01:23,164
Close self ass. - We fucked once.

892
01:01:23,288 --> 01:01:28,580
It's irrelevant. - We regret the contrary, not with each other.

893
01:01:28,704 --> 01:01:32,580
Can we not try to undo together? - It's some lovely girls.

894
01:01:32,704 --> 01:01:36,996
Super Cute girls. - Hardly. We saw them rob your home.

895
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,328
Thank stopped them! - Stood In just and so on?

896
01:01:40,456 --> 01:01:44,872
It was not how it was. - I did not mention the student union.

897
01:01:45,196 --> 01:01:47,612
Can not we work something out?

898
01:01:47,736 --> 01:01:51,656
Yes, I can conjure away the union before tomorrow.

899
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:54,028
POSTPONEMENT

900
01:01:54,156 --> 01:01:57,696
Is it true? - No, it's just the old.

901
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:02,904
No, the landlord said it yourself. - Maybe it was just the old.

902
01:02:03,028 --> 01:02:06,196
No, we have been evicted. We do not rent.

903
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,196
We spent our money on pot.

904
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:13,280
We need five buckets of money. Otherwise we will be evicted tomorrow.

905
01:02:13,404 --> 01:02:18,072
We lose the house. - We lose our sisters.

906
01:02:18,196 --> 01:02:21,612
And we have no friends like in high school.

907
01:02:21,736 --> 01:02:25,444
How do the boys money? - They take admission to festivities.

908
01:02:25,572 --> 01:02:30,196
People will not pay an entrance fee here. - The boys do not come and say:

909
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:33,196
"You look good in your everyday clothes." - Wait.

910
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,656
"Nice sweater." - I have an idea!

911
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:39,444
Okay. - But I will not break you about it.

912
01:02:39,572 --> 01:02:42,904
We hold a party. - We lose money when we're having a party.

913
01:02:43,028 --> 01:02:46,780
Not one of the great parties where we have fun.

914
01:02:46,904 --> 01:02:49,864
We keep a shit boy celebration.

915
01:02:49,988 --> 01:02:53,988
The boys must be so loved it that they will pay an entrance fee -

916
01:02:54,112 --> 01:02:59,236
- And tell their rotten friends about it so they will also pay an entrance fee.

917
01:02:59,364 --> 01:03:02,820
Just like the night we met. - Otherwise we lose the house.

918
01:03:02,944 --> 01:03:06,444
And so we lose Kappa Nu. I will not lose jer.

919
01:03:06,772 --> 01:03:09,936
Okay. - We'll tell the girls.

920
01:03:10,064 --> 01:03:14,436
We will not lose the association and housing.

921
01:03:14,564 --> 01:03:18,936
So we have to dress a little "rougher" than we usually do.

922
01:03:19,064 --> 01:03:23,564
I am naughty. I tufted pizza tender and gave him five stars on Yelp.

923
01:03:23,688 --> 01:03:26,980
You have chips in their hair. - Yes.

924
01:03:30,856 --> 01:03:32,564
INVITES YOU !!!

925
01:03:32,688 --> 01:03:36,480
FOR PARTY

926
01:03:39,396 --> 01:03:41,104
ENTRY: $ 20

927
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,356
BOYS ARE WELCOME!

928
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:50,520
The video looks just like a million. - We're screwed! We go bankrupt.

929
01:03:50,644 --> 01:03:52,480
No, look good on it.

930
01:03:52,604 --> 01:03:56,228
It is stung by them. They have everything they hated.

931
01:03:56,356 --> 01:03:59,144
Holy shit. - They are vulnerable.

932
01:03:59,272 --> 01:04:01,856
The party will finance the house.

933
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,064
He is right. - If we close it closes the association.

934
01:04:05,188 --> 01:04:09,812
Now, the adult ones lost. - I'll give them all lost.

935
01:04:09,936 --> 01:04:15,064
We do what adults do best: To prevent young people from having fun!

936
01:04:21,188 --> 01:04:23,356
Come on in!

937
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:30,104
I hope you close yourself into a little later.

938
01:04:30,528 --> 01:04:33,196
You are funny.

939
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,320
Call your friends and tell them to come.

940
01:04:36,444 --> 01:04:42,236
We must close the shit at any cost. I go in and close it from the inside.

941
01:04:42,364 --> 01:04:45,820
Me and Kelly calling the cops and closes the outside.

942
01:04:45,944 --> 01:04:48,488
From the inside, from the outside. Understood.

943
01:04:54,944 --> 01:04:58,196
Now I am ready. - Yes. Now I am ready.

944
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,320
Honestly, man!

945
01:05:08,156 --> 01:05:10,656
Hello. - What then, Kappa Nu?

946
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:15,656
It only costs 20 Come here. They are drenched. Seriously.

947
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:19,864
There is ridiculously many delicious bitches. There are delicious bitches everywhere.

948
01:05:19,988 --> 01:05:23,236
They are ready to be popped.

949
01:05:23,364 --> 01:05:27,028
How much money forehead do we have?

950
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:30,112
Punch tastes weird. - We have not made punch.

951
01:05:30,236 --> 01:05:32,572
I commence phase second

952
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:36,612
Phase 2 is to hold the old from calling the cops.

953
01:05:36,736 --> 01:05:39,780
If you see some old people, stop them.

954
01:05:39,904 --> 01:05:42,196
I do not like it here. - No.

955
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,444
You should not drink it. - My tongue is numb.

956
01:05:45,572 --> 01:05:48,656
Among the lines with people. - Yes, from, from, from.

957
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,072
Excuse me.

958
01:05:54,028 --> 01:05:59,820
Good party. I write to my friends. - No. They do not think you're funny.

959
01:06:00,144 --> 01:06:04,188
Oh damn! - Are you okay? What's wrong?

960
01:06:04,312 --> 01:06:10,188
I should not have eaten the McRib. It is nothing. I just cramp.

961
01:06:10,312 --> 01:06:14,312
I think it is labor. - No, she has first forward tomorrow.

962
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:19,644
It is clearly labor. Take time on them. - It is over. I'm fine.

963
01:06:19,772 --> 01:06:24,020
She did not labor. Then she slipped.

964
01:06:24,144 --> 01:06:28,312
Go after her. - She decide over his body.

965
01:06:28,436 --> 01:06:32,104
Last night of freedom! - I love you!

966
01:06:32,228 --> 01:06:36,272
We must be up to the relay. What are you doing? You should not drink it there.

967
01:06:36,396 --> 01:06:41,728
What is it? - You never drink the punch! Come on.

968
01:06:52,728 --> 01:06:57,644
I saw you with Teddy. Why were you with Teddy?

969
01:06:57,772 --> 01:07:02,312
We interrupt the flow and closes the party.

970
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:07,856
What? - I was totally stiff quickly.

971
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:11,104
I did too. And I've only been drinking punch.

972
01:07:11,228 --> 01:07:13,564
There is provided a Cosby on us!

973
01:07:18,356 --> 01:07:19,396
And!

974
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:27,144
Kappa Nu, then it's goodnight.

975
01:07:37,772 --> 01:07:40,312
They must have another power source.

976
01:07:40,436 --> 01:07:43,312
Banana!

977
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,312
I have to stop you!

978
01:07:51,396 --> 01:07:56,188
Look at how big my tongue. - Look how big my tongue.

979
01:08:00,188 --> 01:08:03,272
Okay, now we will call to panserne. - Hello!

980
01:08:03,396 --> 01:08:07,104
It will be difficult without a phone, right? - Come with it!

981
01:08:07,228 --> 01:08:08,980
No! - Put it!

982
01:08:11,272 --> 01:08:13,856
What the hell? - It's called a wire, you fool.

983
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:15,480
Lede pensioner phone!

984
01:08:19,688 --> 01:08:22,936
Where are our phones? - These?

985
01:08:23,064 --> 01:08:24,896
How did you get them?

986
01:08:25,856 --> 01:08:27,272
Come on!

987
01:08:28,856 --> 01:08:32,356
I could not find the relay. - Do you have a phone?

988
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,856
No, I have run out of data. - Shit!

989
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:39,520
I'm in here. 
Do not try to find me.

990
01:08:40,856 --> 01:08:45,064
Even close. 
It's getting warmer.

991
01:08:45,188 --> 01:08:48,856
It's getting warmer. Bingo!

992
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,356
Shit. - No!

993
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:56,564
I shut you not out until we have enough money. There are energy bars in the corner.

994
01:08:56,688 --> 01:08:59,644
There is water. And it says a fucking bucket. - Shit!

995
01:08:59,772 --> 01:09:01,644
Come back. - Kelly!

996
01:09:01,772 --> 01:09:04,936
Shelby! Come back! - Help us!

997
01:09:05,064 --> 01:09:07,480
Now you come back.

998
01:09:07,604 --> 01:09:09,688
She has locked it.

999
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:13,020
Okay, calm on. Use your head.

1000
01:09:13,144 --> 01:09:17,144
Okay, now you need to hear. We throw everything we can at the door.

1001
01:09:17,272 --> 01:09:20,272
What are you doing? - I shit when I'm nervous.

1002
01:09:20,396 --> 01:09:24,564
Look away. - Suck it up again. We're going out.

1003
01:09:24,688 --> 01:09:27,520
Of the road. - Strong man.

1004
01:09:29,228 --> 01:09:31,604
Pis! Okay.

1005
01:09:33,896 --> 01:09:36,936
Shit! Pardon.

1006
01:09:37,064 --> 01:09:41,856
Pardon. We try something else. - I am alright.

1007
01:09:46,604 --> 01:09:49,520
Shit. Are you okay, Mac? - Yes.

1008
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,980
You destroyed my bike. - It did not work.

1009
01:09:58,104 --> 01:10:01,104
No. Can you do it again? - I think...

1010
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,604
There we have it. How do we get out.

1011
01:10:10,896 --> 01:10:14,564
It's too high. - No.

1012
01:10:14,688 --> 01:10:18,356
I have not the key. Quick Connect, we'll run through the wall.

1013
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:24,604
I can not, but I know a lot about airbags.

1014
01:10:27,604 --> 01:10:30,188
Quietly.

1015
01:10:34,104 --> 01:10:35,772
Okay.

1016
01:10:35,896 --> 01:10:38,436
If we do it right -

1017
01:10:38,564 --> 01:10:42,064
- Shoot airbag us up through the ventilation shaft.

1018
01:10:42,188 --> 01:10:45,020
Okay. Who does that?

1019
01:10:45,144 --> 01:10:48,812
I do. - Thank God. I do not think I can.

1020
01:10:50,396 --> 01:10:54,520
Are you okay? - Are we still friends after this?

1021
01:10:54,644 --> 01:10:58,188
Want to be seen? - Yes.

1022
01:10:58,312 --> 01:11:03,936
When the war is over, that means I still matter to you?

1023
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:06,020
And.

1024
01:11:08,104 --> 01:11:10,436
Prove it. - Prove what?

1025
01:11:12,188 --> 01:11:14,936
Give me a hug.

1026
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,644
It is not necessary. - Give me a hug.

1027
01:11:17,772 --> 01:11:20,896
Give me a real hug. - Why?

1028
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:24,188
It strengthens the bond.

1029
01:11:24,812 --> 01:11:27,520
Come on.

1030
01:11:29,312 --> 01:11:32,812
I appreciate you, man. Thanks.

1031
01:11:32,936 --> 01:11:35,064
It's actually nice.

1032
01:11:36,228 --> 01:11:40,064
No, it's so nice.

1033
01:11:40,188 --> 01:11:44,064
Yes like that. - It's strong.

1034
01:11:44,188 --> 01:11:50,064
Yes. - Okay, now it becomes too much.

1035
01:11:50,188 --> 01:11:53,812
Thank you my friend. - I like it vennepis.

1036
01:11:53,936 --> 01:11:56,728
We are friends. - Yes. So we do it.

1037
01:11:56,856 --> 01:12:00,812
Before you do, we may just be absolutely sure -

1038
01:12:00,936 --> 01:12:03,896
- That you stand right under it.

1039
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:08,312
Clear. - 1, 2, 3!

1040
01:12:09,604 --> 01:12:13,396
Oh no! Are you okay?

1041
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,396
Yes Yes. I have mastered it.

1042
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,896
No. You've certainly got concussion.

1043
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:23,980
I just need to have 10 minutes. - No. Now I will take over.

1044
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,020
Careful.

1045
01:12:32,188 --> 01:12:35,688
Okay. This is it.

1046
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,396
Now I will deliver the family.

1047
01:12:52,188 --> 01:12:54,728
Are you okay? - It worked!

1048
01:13:00,936 --> 01:13:04,604
I have purchased the old road.

1049
01:13:04,728 --> 01:13:07,228
They are locked up in the garage. - What is it?

1050
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:16,436
It's a shit party. - I will not be here anymore.

1051
01:13:16,564 --> 01:13:18,644
It runs for us. - Do it?

1052
01:13:19,072 --> 01:13:22,236
Wet T-shirt contest!

1053
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:24,820
You are all winners! - Do not!

1054
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:27,988
I stop.

1055
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,112
So do I. - I am out of here.

1056
01:13:30,236 --> 01:13:33,112
No, you must not. We will figure it out. Wait!

1057
01:13:33,156 --> 01:13:36,072
Wait. Now, let's just talk about it.

1058
01:13:36,236 --> 01:13:38,572
Stop a second. Wait.

1059
01:13:38,736 --> 01:13:41,156
Become now just below. Try to hear.

1060
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:45,112
The party has been even greater.

1061
01:13:46,912 --> 01:13:49,036
What happened? - I've got Rohypnol.

1062
01:13:49,204 --> 01:13:52,828
So if I want to have sex with me, so it is now.

1063
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:58,120
The plan is almost complete. The old is gone. We Kappa Nu.

1064
01:13:58,288 --> 01:14:01,204
It was not what we wanted with Kappa Nu.

1065
01:14:01,372 --> 01:14:04,956
Stops In only? - You have ruined it.

1066
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,080
I look like Nicki Minaj! - I look like Snooki!

1067
01:14:08,244 --> 01:14:13,120
I am the only one who tried to save it, and then progresses I just.

1068
01:14:13,288 --> 01:14:16,872
It falls apart. - Should we destroy their friendship?

1069
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:20,620
We are in the middle of the withdrawal period.

1070
01:14:20,788 --> 01:14:23,788
We tried. We worked hard for it. It does not.

1071
01:14:23,956 --> 01:14:27,204
We have the whole system against us. Longer is not.

1072
01:14:27,372 --> 01:14:29,456
Okay. I give up.

1073
01:14:30,328 --> 01:14:33,372
The world is sexist, and we can not change.

1074
01:14:33,536 --> 01:14:37,912
Think that it's over. - Now I lose all my friends.

1075
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,164
I wish we had never created the association.

1076
01:14:41,328 --> 01:14:43,372
It is not good. - No.

1077
01:14:43,536 --> 01:14:46,288
They're just young.

1078
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,744
Hello! Women!

1079
01:14:52,872 --> 01:14:55,536
Take care, however, together, dammit.

1080
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:59,244
You are strong women. In trying to challenge the system.

1081
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:02,204
I just moved from home, and I'm scared.

1082
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:06,664
Yes, I'm afraid. - I know what it's about.

1083
01:15:06,828 --> 01:15:10,204
Yes we do. What is it about?

1084
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:13,620
I must not fail yourselves. - Say something more.

1085
01:15:13,788 --> 01:15:17,456
When you're going down, to travel themselves. They can not keep you down.

1086
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,412
Did you straight on that? - Yes.

1087
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:20,996
Kelly.

1088
01:15:21,164 --> 01:15:24,080
Say that they have to make out with each other.

1089
01:15:24,244 --> 01:15:26,912
It is those Kappa Nu, not the house.

1090
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,956
It is you who are Kappa Nu, not the house.

1091
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,956
The mother is right. What are we doing?

1092
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,996
We hold a party, we like, and stores the worries for tomorrow.

1093
01:15:37,164 --> 01:15:41,704
Never mind if we lose it there. I hope we do not lose it here.

1094
01:15:47,664 --> 01:15:51,412
Girls ... - I'm so happy.

1095
01:15:54,328 --> 01:15:57,244
Boy, I'd like to see them kissing.

1096
01:15:59,372 --> 01:16:01,912
Good speech, sweet. Where did you get it?

1097
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:05,456
We have a daughter, baby. - What about the cooling-off period?

1098
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:08,704
I do not know, but it should be done. - Okay.

1099
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,456
Jimmy! Where are you?

1100
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:14,580
Shit! Paula.

1101
01:16:18,288 --> 01:16:22,120
I think I was wrong. It is not McRib'en.

1102
01:16:23,288 --> 01:16:25,912
Oh god, no!

1103
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,244
It has its feet after me. It has broken through.

1104
01:16:30,412 --> 01:16:32,536
Run in the hospital!

1105
01:16:32,704 --> 01:16:34,664
I love you. - I love you too.

1106
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:08,620
We lose our house? - We have no money, then yes.

1107
01:17:08,788 --> 01:17:11,620
So it must have gas!

1108
01:17:13,664 --> 01:17:18,080
It's a great party! It succeeded you. A girl association may hold celebrations.

1109
01:17:18,244 --> 01:17:20,828
We would like to be members. - Who are we?

1110
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:30,496
Throw the membership fee in the bucket, if you will enrolled.

1111
01:17:30,664 --> 01:17:33,956
Do we go with the hoodie? I like nice clothes.

1112
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,164
No, I can go into it, I will.

1113
01:17:37,328 --> 01:17:40,164
Welcome to Kappa Nu! - Welcome!

1114
01:17:43,496 --> 01:17:48,456
Come on in! Money in the bucket.

1115
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:51,288
Yes, money in the bucket.

1116
01:18:04,664 --> 01:18:07,912
Pete. Wake up, Pete.

1117
01:18:09,872 --> 01:18:12,580
What the hell? What happens ... What are you doing?

1118
01:18:12,744 --> 01:18:16,328
Take it easy. Try to hear. I'm sorry.

1119
01:18:16,496 --> 01:18:18,244
I'm sorry.

1120
01:18:18,412 --> 01:18:21,080
I did not do well when you were engaged.

1121
01:18:21,244 --> 01:18:26,536
I thought I lost you. But then I realized that I never lose you.

1122
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:32,164
For we will always be brothers, right?

1123
01:18:32,328 --> 01:18:34,080
Always.

1124
01:18:34,244 --> 01:18:38,956
I do not lose my best friend. I get my best friend's husband.

1125
01:18:40,788 --> 01:18:42,744
For satan!

1126
01:18:42,912 --> 01:18:46,828
It is okay. Teddy and I have just become friends again.

1127
01:18:50,456 --> 01:18:53,456
May I ask you something? - Yes.

1128
01:18:55,828 --> 01:18:59,536
Will you be my maid of honor?

1129
01:18:59,704 --> 01:19:02,704
Holy shit. Do you mean it? - Yes.

1130
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:03,996
Yes I will.

1131
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:07,788
I love you. You too.

1132
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:12,704
Come here. - Now I have two brothers.

1133
01:19:20,912 --> 01:19:26,328
There is more to your rotten be yourself-fest than your sell-out party. Fat.

1134
01:19:26,496 --> 01:19:31,372
It's actually good for you, we are ready -

1135
01:19:31,536 --> 01:19:36,536
- To help you with your forhudelsesperiode because you helped us.

1136
01:19:36,704 --> 01:19:41,328
We have served røvmange money. Eight bucket full.

1137
01:19:41,496 --> 01:19:46,620
And we can not accommodate all the new ones. - Now we can afford to fill two houses.

1138
01:19:46,788 --> 01:19:50,164
Can we rent your house for the additional members?

1139
01:19:50,328 --> 01:19:52,828
It's just a thought.

1140
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:57,872
We are ready to give you four cans a month in rent.

1141
01:19:58,036 --> 01:19:59,744
Five.

1142
01:19:59,912 --> 01:20:03,204
Five. We go with the five. - Five cans per month.

1143
01:20:03,372 --> 01:20:06,996
So we say five buckets. - How!

1144
01:20:07,164 --> 01:20:12,080
We have won! Can you supply each month? - Yes. When can we move in?

1145
01:20:12,244 --> 01:20:16,456
Now. I fucking care. - Landlords. How hard can it be?

1146
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,788
We make it damn. - Fucking!

1147
01:20:21,456 --> 01:20:24,704
Yes! Ekstrafest!

1148
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:45,504
RENTED

1149
01:20:47,044 --> 01:20:48,672
Male...

1150
01:20:48,836 --> 01:20:51,504
I'm going to miss the house.

1151
01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:55,756
Our first house. - How Stella was a baby.

1152
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,836
There she took the first step.

1153
01:20:59,004 --> 01:21:01,128
There she said her first words.

1154
01:21:01,296 --> 01:21:03,964
And we measured her.

1155
01:21:04,128 --> 01:21:07,128
Can you see the lines? Do you remember them?

1156
01:21:09,672 --> 01:21:15,464
It goes fast, right? - Yes, it's crazy. Okay.

1157
01:21:15,628 --> 01:21:17,672
Come on.

1158
01:21:17,836 --> 01:21:20,380
Are you coming?

1159
01:21:37,628 --> 01:21:41,836
This is our new house. - You can not even see the neighbors.

1160
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:51,296
I think that we are good parents. We have been parents for Teddy.

1161
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,336
We have been parents for 30 crazy girls.

1162
01:21:54,504 --> 01:21:58,672
We do our best. And more could you not ask, do you?

1163
01:21:58,836 --> 01:22:01,836
But whether we are good parents or not -

1164
01:22:02,004 --> 01:22:06,088
- And our daughters one day look at us like they fraternity girls.

1165
01:22:06,256 --> 01:22:10,544
They do not want anything to do with us. - It's just going to cry about.

1166
01:22:10,712 --> 01:22:13,464
Mor?

1167
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:15,920
Are you afraid? - I'm afraid.

1168
01:22:16,088 --> 01:22:19,756
Come here, sweetie.

1169
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,588
Come here, sweetie.

1170
01:22:23,836 --> 01:22:26,088
Hey, hottie. - Here, sweetie.

1171
01:22:26,256 --> 01:22:29,672
Would you like to sleep? - Not yet.

1172
01:22:29,836 --> 01:22:33,672
Not yet? Do you just enjoy a little first?

1173
01:22:33,836 --> 01:22:36,836
Shall we peek physician-boh? Peep-boh!

1174
01:22:40,756 --> 01:22:44,628
Peep-boh! - Peep-boh!

1175
01:22:44,796 --> 01:22:48,544
Peek-a-boo. You we will always be sweet to us, right?

1176
01:22:48,712 --> 01:22:53,172
We will always be best friends and have something to talk about, right?

1177
01:23:02,628 --> 01:23:05,172
Hey sweety. - Hey sweety.

1178
01:23:05,336 --> 01:23:08,256
I'm sorry not of it. - No.

1179
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:12,796
I love you, baby. - So do I.

1180
01:23:19,712 --> 01:23:21,544
3 MONTHS LATER

1181
01:23:23,756 --> 01:23:28,336
How are you? Well? - Yes. I've got some nerves.

1182
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:30,672
You look amazing. - Thank you.

1183
01:23:30,836 --> 01:23:35,044
It goes? You seem very nervous. - I'm a little upset.

1184
01:23:35,212 --> 01:23:38,380
You should just remember -

1185
01:23:38,588 --> 01:23:42,128
- Darren is the one who loves you maximum worldwide.

1186
01:23:42,296 --> 01:23:45,336
Darren appreciate your friendship.

1187
01:23:45,504 --> 01:23:49,544
Darren can not imagine a life without you.

1188
01:23:49,712 --> 01:23:52,756
And Darren is proud to call you his best friend.

1189
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,544
You're not talking about Darren, do you? - No.

1190
01:23:55,712 --> 01:23:57,964
Let's get you married.

1191
01:23:59,256 --> 01:24:02,004
Okay, wake up, folks.

1192
01:24:02,172 --> 01:24:06,712
Gom 1 and his best man is ready. Are you ready for us?

1193
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:12,212
I am proud of you. You found your niche. - Yes, gay wedding planner.

1194
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:15,004
It's a great job, and you may well be punished.

1195
01:24:15,172 --> 01:24:20,672
My only competence is party planning, and gays like me.

1196
01:24:20,836 --> 01:24:24,044
It's because you're a great guy. - Thank you.

1197
01:24:24,212 --> 01:24:28,920
And they might want to fuck you. - You said it, not me.

1198
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:33,296
Delta Psi.
- Delta Psi.

1199
01:24:33,464 --> 01:24:35,880
Now you need to get married. - Yes.

1200
01:24:36,044 --> 01:24:38,504
We are on the way.

1201
01:24:38,672 --> 01:24:41,964
So we are at home with baby Mildred!

1202
01:24:42,128 --> 01:24:44,880
How are you? - How was the birth?

1203
01:24:45,044 --> 01:24:47,336
It's over. - Yes.

1204
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:49,796
Spoon on the table? - No.

1205
01:24:49,964 --> 01:24:53,256
I did not. - Prof.

1206
01:24:55,128 --> 01:24:58,920
Do you have a gift for your new baby sister? - The child's first dildo.

1207
01:24:59,088 --> 01:25:02,964
Thank you, Stella. - It's like us.

1208
01:25:03,128 --> 01:25:07,088
Show it to them. - It's Jimmy juniors favorite.

1209
01:25:07,256 --> 01:25:11,964
Our vibrators should not have veins. Maybe I obtain one without buns.

1210
01:25:12,128 --> 01:25:15,004
Get it away.

1211
01:25:15,172 --> 01:25:19,088
Want to meet your cousin, Jimmy junior?

1212
01:25:19,256 --> 01:25:24,044
See her once. Try to see. The families meet.

1213
01:25:24,212 --> 01:25:26,880
Se dem.
- Hold da op.

1214
01:25:27,044 --> 01:25:30,588
Hey, Jimmy junior. My name is Mildred. - Where sweet.

1215
01:25:30,756 --> 01:25:34,172
Hello. One day we two will fuck.

1216
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,756
No never.

1217
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,088
Mother and father will teach me about self-respect, so I stick by your type.

1218
01:25:39,956 --> 01:25:42,704
I could go on all day. Now we go.

1219
01:25:42,872 --> 01:25:47,164
Thank you fit Stella. It was really cool.

1220
01:25:47,328 --> 01:25:50,788
She is beautiful. - Hi.

1221
01:25:52,156 --> 01:25:56,904
We did it. We've got a child. - We've got another one.

1222
01:25:57,072 --> 01:25:59,488
I love you. - I love you too.

1223
01:25:59,656 --> 01:26:04,528
Do you kiss your sister, Stella?

1223
01:26:05,305 --> 01:26:11,424
